formulize-joomla
================

Component for the integration of Formulize into Joomla.

It takes care of getting the webmaster input and of displaying the Formulize Screens accordingly.

It also take care of the initial user and group synchronization between the two systems.

For full functionality, it needs to be installed with formulize-plugin. 

Those two parts will be combined at a later point in one single package.


***Note to Julian***

There's two ways to install the two extensions: 

First method:
 
1. Zip formulize-joomla directory and zip formulize-plugin directory
2. Browse to the zipped formulize-joomla using Upload Package File 
3. Hit upload and install
4. Browse to the zipped formulize-plugin using Upload Package File 
5. Hit upload and install

or 

Second method:  (***SIMPLER***)

1. Copy your path to the directory formulize-joomla (including formulize-joomla at the end) in Install from Directory
2. Hit install
3. Copy your path to the directory formulize-plugin (including formulize-plugin at the end) in Install from Directory
4. Hit install
